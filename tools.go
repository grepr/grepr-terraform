// Package tools tracks tool dependencies for this module.

// This file ensures that tool dependencies are recorded in go.mod without being
// imported in regular code. The tools build tag ensures this file is excluded
// from normal builds but included when running `go mod tidy`.

// To regenerate OpenAPI code, run: make generate
